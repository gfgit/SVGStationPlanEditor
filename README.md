# SVGStationPlanEditor
A simple editor for railway station plan in SVG format

## Purpose
This software can add tags to SVG elements so that in an SVG representing the station plan you can automatically select platforms, tracks and labels.

The software can import and parse SVG (for example generated by Inkscape).
The SVG are converted because QtSVG module understands only a subset of SVG specification (SVG Tiny 1.2)

## Supported SVG elements
- `rect`: A rectangular element
- `line`: A segment
- `polyline`: Multiple concatenated segments
- `path`: A complex path
  > NOTE: Only straight lines are supported on paths
